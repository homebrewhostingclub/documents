# Toronto Homebrew Hosting Club on Thursday, 21st April at HackLab

<https://homebrewhosting.club/>

Are you building your own website? Setup and running your own calendar/contacts server? Developing your own publishing web app? Hosting a Gnu-based-social-network? Running your own Wiki? Hosting your own email server? Did you buy a $35 VPS and looking to replace Google Apps with your a self hosted solution? Or some other digital magic-cloud service?

If so, we are a meetup of people in the Greater Toronto Area passionate about self hosting, in the same structure as the [Homebrew Computer Club][1] meetings in Silicon Valley (and the [Homebrew Website Club][2]). It will be a gathering of like-minded people to swap ideas, talk shop, and general awesomeness about hosting your own infrastructure.

Our second meetup will be on Thursday 21st April 2016 at 7:00 p.m. at the Toronto [HackLab][3] (near the corner of [Queen Street West and Dufferin Street][4]).
